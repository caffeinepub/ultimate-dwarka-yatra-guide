  "summary": "REQ-32 appears to be addressed in the data layer (dwarkaGuide.ts interface updated and file summary claims the Sanskruti Novelty card has no image property). However, the diff does not show any actual UI/component changes for Day 3 rendering, so REQ-33 cannot be confirmed/appears unimplemented. The diff also introduces an unrequested placeholder-image concept, which conflicts with the stated non-goals.",

      "requirement": "Ensure the Day 3 recommendation card UI for \"संस्कृति नॉवेल्टी (पुरुषोत्तम भाई मच्छर)\" renders as text-only with no image area rendered (no <img> and no image container/space).",
      "reason": "No UI/tab/component file changes are shown in the diff summary (only 3 files modified: dwarkaGuide.ts, frontend-file-summaries.txt, project_state.json). Without changes to the rendering component, there is insufficient evidence that the DOM will omit an <img> and image container for this card.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly says to delete the `image` property for the specific card and has non-goals forbidding new images or placeholder assets. Introducing placeholder-image fields/assets is not requested and conflicts with non-goals.",
