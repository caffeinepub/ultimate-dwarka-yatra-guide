# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the Day 3 “फोटो और 3D स्टूडियो (Recommended)” / Sanskruti Novelty recommendation card render as text-only (no image and no reserved image space) while keeping the “Recommended” badge.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the image element and any image container/placeholder spacing from the Day 3 Sanskruti Novelty recommendation card so it displays text-only.
- Set the Sanskruti Novelty card text to exactly match the specified Title, Subtitle, and Description without changing any other text in that card.

**User-visible outcome:** On Day 3, the Sanskruti Novelty “Recommended” card shows the badge and the exact provided text, with no image and no blank image area.
