# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the offline/bundled itinerary guide content for Day 2 and Day 3, and add a highlighted “Sanskruti Novelty” card.

**Planned changes:**
- Update Day 2 itinerary content using the exact user-provided Hindi strings (including any place text updates).
- Update Day 3 itinerary content using the exact user-provided Hindi strings, including preserving the Beyt Dwarka timing note exactly as provided.
- Add a highlighted “Sanskruti Novelty” card in the guide UI with a placeholder image slot/URL (no real shop photography).

**User-visible outcome:** The itinerary screens show the revised Day 2 and Day 3 content (with Hindi text unchanged from what was provided), and users see a new highlighted Sanskruti Novelty card with a placeholder image area.
